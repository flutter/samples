# Veggie Seasons

An app that shows which fruits and vegetables are currently in season. It
showcases Flutter's Cupertino package.

[Available now in the App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/is/app/veggie-seasons/id1450855435)

## Goals

* Show how to build an interface that iOS users will feel right at home
  with.
* Show how Flutter's Cupertino widgets work together.

## The important bits

### `/screens/*`

These are the screens presented in the app, roughly analogous to
UIViewControllers. `HomeScreen` is the root, and the others are shown
as the user navigates.

### `/widgets/search_bar.dart`

An example of how to construct an Cupertino-style search bar. The
Flutter team [is working on an official widget](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9784)
for this. Once that effort is complete, developers will not need to roll
their own search bars, so to speak.
