# Veggie Seasons

An iOS sample app that shows which fruits and vegetables are currently in season. It
showcases Flutter's Cupertino package.

**NOTE:** While Flutter supports many platforms, this application is designed
specifically for iOS. It's not intended to be run on Android, web, or desktop.

## Goals

* Show how to build an interface that iOS users will feel right at home
  with.
* Show how Flutter's Cupertino widgets work together.

## The important bits

### `/screens/*`

These are the screens presented in the app, roughly analogous to
UIViewControllers. `HomeScreen` is the root, and the others are shown
as the user navigates.
