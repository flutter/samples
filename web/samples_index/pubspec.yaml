# package:mdc_web needs to upgrade the version of material-components-web 12.0.0
# or above, which includes this fix for the division operator:

# https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/pull/7158
#
# Until then, dart-sass produces a warning that this operator is being removed
# in favor of calc().
