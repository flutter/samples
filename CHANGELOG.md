# Changelog

The purpose of this changelog is to track the freshness of samples and which
samples reflect *current best practices*. It describes **human-made, significant
** changes made to the repository or samples in the repository.

While all samples in this repository build and run, some of them were written
long ago, and no longer reflect what we want developers to learn. For example,
samples should have been refactored when Dart 3 released to include patterns and
records, where appropriate.

* **DO include:**
    * The addition of new samples.
    * The removal of existing samples.
    * Considerable refactoring of any given sample.

* **DO NOT include:**
    * Simple changes that reflect minor version bumps in Flutter. For example,
      in a recent Flutter update, `Color.red` became `Color.r`.
    * Dependency updates.
    * Bug fixes.
    * Any changes made to simply 'keep the lights on'.
