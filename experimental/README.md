# Master channel samples

In this directory, you'll find samples that target Flutter's master channel.
They may take advantage of new SDK features that haven't landed in the
stable channel, and they may crash, lock up your machine, or otherwise fail to
run correctly. In other words, consider everything in this directory to be an
experiment.

We're maintaining these samples here so that folks can see some of Flutter's
upcoming features as they evolve and get a sense for how they'll eventually
be used. If you'd like to run the apps, make sure to switch the the master
channel first:

```bash
flutter channel master
flutter upgrade
```

When you're done, use this command to return to the safety of the stable
channel:

```bash
flutter channel stable
```
