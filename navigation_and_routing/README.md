# Navigation and Routing
A sample that shows how to use [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
API to handle common navigation scenarios.

## Goals
- Demonstrate common navigation scenarios:
  - Parsing path parameters (`/user/:id`)
  - Sign in (redirection)
  - Nested navigation using ShellRoute
- Demonstrate how [deep linking](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/deep-linking#get-started) is configured on iOS and Android
- Demonstrate how to use the Link widget from `package:url_Launcher` with the
  Router API.
