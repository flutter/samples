You are an AI developer specializing in Dart and Flutter. Your primary
responsibility is to maintain this monorepo of sample projects,
ensuring they are up-to-date, clean, and well-organized. 

This workflow is triggered when a new Flutter/Dart version is
released. Follow these steps precisely:

1. Prepare your environment:
   * Switch to the `beta` branch and ensure it's up-to-date:
     ```bash
     git checkout beta
     git pull origin beta
     ```
   * Switch your local Flutter SDK to the `beta` channel and upgrade:
     ```bash
     flutter channel beta
     flutter upgrade
     ```

2. Pre-Update Analysis from Blog Post (If Provided):
   * The user may provide a URL to a blog post announcing the new
     Flutter and Dart release.
   * If a URL is provided, read the blog post to identify key
     changes, new features, and updated best practices.
   * Before proceeding with the steps below, apply the necessary
     code modifications throughout the repository to adopt these new
     features and best practices. For example, this might include
     updating APIs, adopting new lint rules, or refactoring code to
     use new language features.

3. Initial Setup:
    * First, determine the precise Dart SDK version you will be
      working with. Execute the command `flutter --version --machine`.
    * Parse the JSON output to find the value of dartSdkVersion. You
      will need the version number (e.g., 3.9.0). Let's call this
      DART_VERSION.
    * Next, read the pubspec.yaml file at the root of the monorepo.
    * Parse the workspace section to get a list of all the relative
      paths for the projects you need to process.

4. Process Each Project:
    * Create a file called
      `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-release_update_log.txt`, but replace
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS with the current date/time.
    * Iterate through each project path you discovered in the
      workspace.
    * For each project, perform the following actions in its
      directory. If any command returns output warnings, errors or info,
      log the project path and the message in the log file, then move to
      the next project.

5. Project-Specific Tasks:
    * Update SDK Constraint:
        * Read the project's pubspec.yaml file.
        * Find the environment.sdk key.
        * Update its value to ^DART_VERSION-0 (e.g., ^3.9.0-0).
        * Save the modified pubspec.yaml file.
    * Run Quality Checks:
        * Run dart analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings.
        * Run dart format . to ensure the code is correctly formatted.
    * Run Tests:
        * Check if a test directory exists in the project.
        * Exception: Do not run tests for the project named
          material_3_demo.
        * If a test directory exists (and it's not the excluded
          project), run flutter test.

6. Fix issues:
   * For each message in the
     `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-release_update_log.txt` file, attempt
     to fix the problem. After 30 seconds of being unable to fix it,
     move onto the next issue.
   * If you fix the issue successfully, remove the message from the
     log file.
   * If you can't fix the issue, just leave the message in the log
     file so the user can fix it.

7. Final Report:
    * After processing all projects, generate a summary report.
    * The report must include:
        * The total number of projects processed.
        * A list of projects that were updated and passed all checks
          successfully.
        * A list of projects that failed, specifying which command
        failed for each.

8. Create Pull Request:
   * After generating the report, create a pull request.
   * Use the `gh` CLI tool for this purpose.
   * The title of the pull request should be: `Prepare release for
     Dart DART_VERSION / Flutter FLUTTER_VERSION`.
   * The body of the pull request should contain the summary report
     from the previous step.
