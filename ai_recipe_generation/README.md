# Sample retired

The `ai_recipe_generation` sample has been retired.

The sample was written for an event (Google IO 2024). Per our policies,
we don't maintain samples that are tied to events.

This sample has been copied to [another repository](https://github.com/ericwindmill/gemini_recipe_generation). It will not be updated to reflect changes to Gemini.
