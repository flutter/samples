# A curated list of samples

Contained in this list are sample apps, demos, and examples that can help you
grow your Flutter skills. Some are maintained here by the Flutter team,
but many have been created by the Flutter community and are kept in other repos
in and out of GitHub.

This is not an exhaustive list of samples, and just because a project
isn't listed here doesn't mean that it's not worth exploring. Similarly, while
the Flutter team works to keep this list up to date, there are plenty of others
created by the community, such as
[Awesome Flutter](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter) from @Solido.

***Please don't submit pull requests directly updating this file. While we're
always happy to learn of new samples from the community, we need
to keep this file small. There are plenty of user-maintained indices (like
[Awesome Flutter](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter)) that are meant to
be exhaustive, and those are great places for submitting your own work.***
