  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Roboto Condensed
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/RobotoCondensed-Light.ttf
         weight: 400
       - asset: fonts/RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf
         weight: 500
       - asset: fonts/RobotoCondensed-Bold.ttf
         weight: 700
   - family: Eczar
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/Eczar-Regular.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Eczar-Bold.ttf
         weight: 500
