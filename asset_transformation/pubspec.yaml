    # Here, we have an SVG image that we want to display in our app. Flutter 
    # cannot render SVG images itself, but there are packages that can.
    # The vector_graphics package is one such app that can quickly render SVGs,
    # but only after they have been run through the vector_graphics_compiler
    # package first. Instead of having to do this manually ourselves, we
    # can simply specify vector_graphics_compiler as a transformer on this asset.

    # Run the application using `flutter run` to see how these assets get rendered.
